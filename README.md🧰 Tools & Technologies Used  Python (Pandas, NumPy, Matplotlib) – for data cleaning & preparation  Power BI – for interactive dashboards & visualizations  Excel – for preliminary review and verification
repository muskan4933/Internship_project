📊 Amazon Sales Data Analysis Project
🧾 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales transactions to identify key trends, customer behavior, fulfillment performance, and geographical insights.
The main goal was to clean, prepare, and visualize the data using Python (Pandas) and Power BI, helping business teams make data-driven decisions.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The dataset initially contained missing values, inconsistent entries, and formatting issues.
The following steps were performed for cleaning:

-Handled Missing Values – Replaced blanks or “Missing” with NaN and filled or removed based on context.

-Standardized Column Names – Used consistent naming conventions (e.g., Order_ID, Ship_City, Amount).

-Data Type Conversion – Converted:

-Date → datetime format

-Amount → numeric type

-Corrected Inconsistent Entries – Standardized city and state names (e.g., “pune” → “Pune”).

-Removed Duplicates – Ensured all Order_IDs are unique.

-Conditional Column for Amount –

-If Status = Cancelled → Amount = 0

If Status = Delivered → Amount = median value

Else → Retained the original amount

After these steps, the dataset was ready for analysis and visualization.

📈 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard was created to present the insights visually and interactively.

Dashboard Components:

=Sales Overview: Total revenue, total orders, sales trend (daily/monthly).

=Product Analysis: Quantity sold by category, top-selling products and sizes.

-fulfillment & Channel: Performance comparison between Amazon and Merchant fulfillment.

-Geographical Analysis: Sales distribution by city and state using map visuals.

-Customer Insights: Spending behavior and buying frequency segmentation.
